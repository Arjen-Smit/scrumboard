TODO:


- Move /Helix/Externals back to /vendor
- Remove /vendor packages from git
- Move the router out of the database to a class to use it more flexable and faster.
- Implement Guard, with composer
- Search for a javascript optimizer for guard, that can handle jQuery maybe https://github.com/imathis/guard-stitch-plus
- move twig to the controller classes
